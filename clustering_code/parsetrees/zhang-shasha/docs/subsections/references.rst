The algorithm used by :py:mod:`zss` is taken directly from the original paper
by Zhang and Shasha. If you would like to discuss the paper, or the the tree
edit distance problem (we have implemented a few other algorithms as well)
please email the authors.

`approxlib <http://www.inf.unibz.it/~augsten/src/>`_ by Dr. Nikolaus Augstent
contains a good Java implementation of Zhang-Shasha as well as a number of
other useful tree distance algorithms.
