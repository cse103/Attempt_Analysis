1) Order attempts first according to the problem part number.
2) Ignore students which find the correct answer in less than some
amount (default 1 minute)
3) report for each problem part, and each cluster, the total number of
minutes spent attempting to solve the problem. Make this number (as
well as the number of elements in the cluster) appear at the top.
4) Make it easy to find the hot spots by using "grep"
